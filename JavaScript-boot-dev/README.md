# JavaScript Course - Boot.dev

I completed the JavaScript course from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-javascript) as part of the Backend Path - TypeScript track.

## About This Repository

Since I was studying in guest mode, some assignments and test cases weren't accessible through the platform (CH 4 and later), but it is available to read. I solved these assignments locally and added additional test cases to strengthen my understanding.

This repository includes:
- Local solutions for course assignments
- Additional test cases I created
- A helper shell script to run unit tests for individual lessons or entire chapters

## Course Experience

This course was excellent! While I could write and ship JavaScript codes before, this course really tightened my understanding and gave me a solid grasp of the language. I used to find JavaScript goosy/difficult and not that cool of a language, but this course changed my perspective. The more I learned about JS, the more fine it became to code with.

### New Concepts I Learned
- **Prototypes** - Understanding JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance
- **Sets and Maps** - Modern data structures and their use cases, Objects vs. Maps.  
- **Modules** - Strict Mode, Browser Module, Bundles 

### Concepts That Became Much Clearer
- **Functions** - Fat arrow functions vs normal functions.
- **Promises** - Asynchronous programming and handling async operations

## Local Test Results

## Future Plans

I plan to release these test cases, main.js files with no solutions, and the helper utility for running unit tests in a separate repository, along with materials from other boot.dev courses I'll be completing.
